# Bank-Transactions-SQL

This repository contains the **first part** of an SQL project simulating bank transactions data.  
The goal of this stage is to design the database schema, populate it with sample data generated entirely via SQL statements, and perform initial business analysis with stored procedures.  
Subsequent parts will include **views**, **data analysis**, and **complex SQL queries** for deeper insights.

---

## Current Contents

- **Database schema creation** using `CREATE TABLE`
- Use of `ENUM` type for transaction categories  
  (e.g., `deposit`, `withdrawal`, `transfer`, `payment`)
- Data generation with `INSERT` statements and MySQL functions like `RAND()`  
- Predefined lists of names and countries (prepared beforehand without importing external datasets)
- **Stored procedures for analysis**, including:
  - Top clients by monthly transaction sum
  - Average balance by country
  - Deposit and withdrawal totals per client
  - Active vs. total users ratio
  - Top countries by high-balance users

---

## Data Generation Notes

- No external datasets or automated generation software were used.  
- Name and country lists were manually prepared in advance (with ChatGPT assistance for idea generation).  
- All final data insertion logic is implemented directly in MySQL.

---

## Next Steps (Upcoming Parts)

- **Create views** for reusable reporting and analytics
- Explore indexing strategies for performance optimization

---

## Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Data Type Highlights**: `ENUM`, `DATE`, `DECIMAL`, `AUTO_INCREMENT`
